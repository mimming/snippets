# Add a Cat to That

This is a very tiny toy application that I use to demonstrate security stuff.  This stuff might include secure coding
practices, tools, or libraries.

This project contains several **intentional vulnerabilities**.  In other words, do NOT deploy it to production.  If you
decide to deploy it somewhere, keep it safe via other means.  For example, don't let random people on the Internet
connect to it.  Deploy it to a private network, and use a VPN or SSH tunnel to access it.
