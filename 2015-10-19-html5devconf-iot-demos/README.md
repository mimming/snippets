# Code from "Prototyping the Internet of Things with Firebase" at HTML5DevConf 2015

[HTML5DevConf](http://html5devconf.com/) was a blast. Here's my code from the [talk I gave](http://html5devconf.com/speakers/jennifer_tong.html).

Oh, you can find the slides [here](http://mimming.com/presos/internet-of-nodebots/).

## Using this code
